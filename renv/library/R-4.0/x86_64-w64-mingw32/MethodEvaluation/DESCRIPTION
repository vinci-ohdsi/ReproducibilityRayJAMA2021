Description: Resources for the evaluation of the
 performance of methods that aim to estimate the magnitude (relative risk) of
 the effect of a drug on an outcome. These resources include reference sets for
 evaluating methods on real data, as well as functions for inserting simulated
 effects in real data based on negative control drug-outcome pairs. Further
 included are functions for the computation of the minimum detectable relative
 risks and functions for computing performance statistics such as predictive
 accuracy, error and bias.
